            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>After contemplating multiple ways to create an interesting network graph to analyze, we came to the conclusion of comparing 3 of the most important dragons within Skyrim.</p>
            <p>The 3 dragons in question are Aludin, the main villain of the game, Paarthurnax, a wise and myserious dragon who allies himself with the player, and Odahviing, a dragon that makes his appearance later in the game's story who also aids the player.</p>
            <p>Of the 3 dragons, Paarthurnax had the most dialogue by a landslide, followed by Odahviing, and then Alduin. With Paarthurnax and Odahviing both being allies of the player, that gives them more chances to speak. Despite Alduin being the main villain of the game, he rarely speaks to the player until the finale.</p>
            <p>Despite being dragons themselves, these 3 characters speak english more often than dovahzul. This can be explained by the fact that the majority of the time they speak, it's to the player directly, so they use the language that the in-universe character and by extension, the player is able to better understand.</p>
