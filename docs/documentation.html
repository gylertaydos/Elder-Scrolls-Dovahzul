            <h2>Project Documentation</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a text-generating bot that can take input and respond in dovahzul, the constructed language (or conlang) of the dragons from <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>
            <p>The sources for this project can be found under the Sources tab at the top navigation bar. Our primary source for the conlang came from <a href="https://www.thuum.org/">Thu'um.org</a>, a community-driven community dedicated to learning and use of dovahzul. Using the 5th Edition Dragon-English dictionary, as well as some scraped text files from <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page">The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a> wiki, we were able to assemble a small collection of files of the language in action.</p>
            <p>Once our source files were formatted, we turned to <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Huggingface.co</a> to find a pretrained LLM (large language model) which we could train with our dragon text files. We settled on <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom">BLOOM</a>, a LLM made to continue text from a prompt and output text in 46 different languages.</p>
            <p>Currently, we are experimenting with BLOOM and learning how to feed it our training data.</p>
