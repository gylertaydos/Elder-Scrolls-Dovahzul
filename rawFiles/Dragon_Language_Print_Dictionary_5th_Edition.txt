    A    Dragon Language Dictionary Dragon-English English-Dragon  Fifth Edition  www.thuum.org                     The dragon language is a creation of Bethesda Softworks, LLC. The Elder Scrolls®, Skyrim®, their logos, branding elements, and artwork are intellectual property of Bethesda, LLC. Any of these featured herein are used for noncommercial, educational purposes. This dictionary is unofficial and does not claim any ownership of the above or any affiliation with Bethesda Softworks, LLC.    Introduction  The dragon language, commonly referred to by fans as Dovahzul (“dragon-voice”), is a fictional language featured in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This dictionary contains detailed, comprehensive entries for all 647 words attested in the canonical language organized by the Thuum.org community. The language, and our understanding of it, has changed drastically over the years. Thuum.org initially set out to expand the language by allowing fans to submit new words. This crowdsourced effort helped build a community, but was unfortunately undertaken at a time when we didn’t understand the language much at all (we didn’t know what we didn’t know). This resulted in a lot of energy being put toward revising the 6,000 fanmade words to catch up with our understanding of the language. The constant change not only made the language difficult to learn, but an approach to the language developed that I felt wasn’t in the spirit of Bethesda’s original work. Between a word submission system that promoted finding missing English translations and the word-for-word nature of the online translator which was prone to error, a lot of Thuum.org’s tools and materials geared students toward thinking of the dragon language in a very English-centric mindset. I felt we had lost the character of Bethesda’s dragon language somewhere along way. This resulted in hard conversations about what to do with all the community’s work and how to move the language forward. In the end, we decided step away from the fanmade vocabulary we had been fostering for years, and shift back to the canonical language. Even though we have left that work behind, we greatly appreciate everyone’s support and dedication over the years. The site and community certainly wouldn’t have been the same without all of your contributions. We spent months compiling a new dictionary sourced entirely from official content, and reexamining everything we thought we knew about the language and how we knew it. In each entry, you’ll find citations and examples to help illustrate the definitions. We also established a new parts of speech system to best describe the language in its own terms. In the end, I hope this new dictionary proves to be the most authoritative and comprehensive resource on the dragon language yet. A huge thank you to everyone who was involved to help make this happen, and who continue to show their support for the site and the language even 6 years removed from Skyrim. Frin unslaad! -paarthurnax, Thuum.org administrator    About the Dictionary  All officially recognized usage of the dragon language—the dragon language corpus—spans from in-game dialogue, books, music, developer notes, and external official guides in print or online. The contents of this dictionary were written by examining the entirety of the corpus and consolidating all known information in one place. The following breaks down the dictionary entry format so you can find exactly what you're looking for and make the most of the information provided.  Understanding Dictionary Entries Each dictionary entry covers a distinct word with its own definition and usage. Only base words have dictionary entries (e.g., dovah 'dragon' has a dedicated entry, but dovahhe 'dragons' does not). When looking for a word, make sure to look for the base word. There are some exceptions where the base word might not occur, or where a word's base form might not be readily obvious. The goal of each dictionary entry is to succinctly describe the meaning of a word and demonstrate its usage as it officially occurs. Many specifics of the dragon language are unknown or unexplained. Dictionary entries may provide additional, unofficial notes to expand the understanding of a word beyond what is officially documented. These notes are based on extended analysis, taking into account the language as it occurs in-game and the process by which Bethesda created it, and represent the best current understanding of the language. As these notes are ultimately hypothetical in nature, you are free to heed or ignore them for your own purposes. We encourage you to read the source material and draw your own conclusions.  Word The Word section provides the dragon word in both the original dragon runes and the romanization. Words are spelled as observed in-game or in official external material, such as the Prima Games guide. Dragon rune spellings are derived from each word's official romanization and the official alphabet. Not all words appear written in dragon runes in-game. The dragon words presented in the dictionary entries are the standard spellings. There are some spelling discrepancies between official guide material and actual in-game usage, in particular misspellings that are found in the subtitles and dialogue files. For the sake of completeness, the most common misspellings have their own dictionary entries to reference. In cases where a word may only occur once, the spelling listed in the official guide is determined to be official. The spelling of related words also determines official spelling. If you cannot find a word, try looking at nearby words in case the word you are looking for may be misspelled.  Pronunciation The Pronunciation section provides the word's pronunciation using the International Phonetic Alphabet. The pronunciations provided are broad transcriptions for the sake of readability and accuracy. See the Alphabet & Pronunciation section for more on dragon language pronunciation. Some words may list multiple pronunciations. Pronunciations are listed in order from most typical to least typical. The dragon alphabet is highly phonemic, meaning that words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled. The pronunciations listed are based on in-game pronunciations and the "textbook" pronunciations derived from a word's spelling. Most words do not have recorded pronunciations to reference. In-game pronunciations vary greatly between voice actors and international versions of the game. Textbook pronunciation is derived from the most common observed pronunciations that provide the least amount of overlap between letters. (For example, in textbook pronunciation gron /gron/ 'to bind' and graan /gr.n/ 'to rout' are not homophones, but gron is sometimes pronounced in-game as /gr.n/.) Where in-game pronunciation differs from a word's textbook pronunciation, textbook pronunciation is listed first as the recommended, standard pronunciation. Discrepancies may exist between the syllables listed as stressed in the dictionary and the syllables that are stressed in the in-game pronunciations. Stress placement varies greatly between voice actors. In words that do not have observed pronunciations, stress placement is hypothetical. The root of a word generally receives the stress, and affixes are generally unstressed. Syllables with aa or ii can also influence stress. Stress may also change with the flow of a sentence. The stresses listed are the recommended pronunciations.  Word Type The Word Type section provides the part of speech that a word serves as. Dragon words are highly flexible and may function as multiple parts of speech in different contexts. The parts of speech system used in the Word Type section describes how a word may behave based on in-game examples and analysis. The terms 'strong' and 'weak' denote how adjectives and verbs can be used. 'Strong' indicates an adjective or verb that can also be used as a noun, while 'weak' indicates an adjective or verb that cannot be used as a noun. All words are assumed to be strong unless there in an explicit noun form (e.g. aam 'to serve' is considered a weak verb due to the existence of ahmik 'service'). Words with similar meanings but different etymologies do not inform one another's strong or weak qualities. For example, the existence of vur 'valor' does not make krilot 'valiant' a weak adjective because vur and krilot are unrelated. Some words may be considered strong despite having explicit noun forms. For example, mul 'strong' is considered a strong adjective despite mulaag 'strength' because it is used to mean 'strength' in the Dragon Aspect Shout. The Word Type section is unofficial except where noted in the official definition. A word's listed part of speech may differ from official notes where a word's meaning or behavior better fit the listed part of speech.  Official Definition The Official Definition section lists the word's definition verbatim as it appears in official sources, such as dialogue file developer notes or the Prima Games official guide. Sources are cited beneath the definition. Only the first or most prominent instance is cited if a definition appears in the same source multiple times. A source may be cited multiple times if it contains multiple, distinct definitions. Below is a list of all sources used to produce the official definitions. Brackets indicate variable text, such as a name or number: . ({Shout Name}) - The definition as listed in the in-game Shouts menu. Some Shouts are not directly available to the player and can only be accessed via console commands. See UESP.net for a complete list of Shouts and their corresponding IDs if you wish to verify the definitions in-game. . (Book, {Title}) - The definition as provided from an in-game book. The most commonly cited books are Songs of Skyrim and Dragon Language: Myth No More. . (Dialogue File, {Form ID}) - The definition as provided from developer notes in Skyrim's dialogue file* exported from the Creation Kit. The cited Form ID refers to the specific line or group of dialogue where the definition is listed. Only developer notes and in-game dialogue that explicitly state a definition are considered valid definition sources. In-game dialogue that comments on the dragon language (such as commentary from Paarthurnax) but does not explicitly state a translation is not considered valid, as these comments are often paraphrase. Commentary may be accepted as an official translation where a translation does not exist elsewhere.  * The linked file includes dialogue from the base game but not the Dawnguard or Dragonborn DLCs. Some dialogue citations use notes from Dawnguard or Dragonborn dialogue. These must be verified in the Creation Kit at this time. . (POGGLE, {Page}) - The page in the Prima Games Official Game Guide: Legendary Edition where the word's definition is cited. Definitions are primarily cited from the dragon word list beginning on page 1096, or from the Word Wall transcriptions on the following pages. . (PrimaGames.com) - The definition as provided from Prima Games' online English to Dragon Language list. Some words and notes appear in the PrimGames.com list and nowhere else.  Expanded Definition The Expanded Definition section is an unofficial definition that provides more detail and clarity than might be found in the official definition, including the English parts of speech that a word can be used as. Below are the abbreviations used for each part of speech: adj.  adjective adv.  adverb art.  article conj.  conjunction interj.  interjection n.  noun pref.  prefix prep.  preposition suff.  suffix v.  verb Expanded definitions are based on the part of speech listed in the Word Type section. The expanded definition may list parts of speech that do not occur in canon usage. This is done in favor of flexibility and to satisfy the part of speech system developed to describe the language. You may choose to use words only in the way that they are used in canon.  Usage The Usage section lists and cites occurrences of the word where it officially appears. The Usage section does not list every occurrence, but those that best demonstrate the definition. Similarly, some sources are not reproduced in their entirety but with enough context to portray the word. Each usage is followed by a translation and a citation. Translations are official and reproduced verbatim where official translations are provided in the source. Unofficial translations are written in square brackets where no official translation is provided, and are written in as literal a manner as possible. Below is a list of all sources used to produce the Usage section. Brackets indicate variable text, such as a name or number: . ({Shout Name}) - The word as it appears in the in-game Shouts. Some Shouts are not directly available to the player and can only be accessed via console commands. See UESP.net for a complete list of Shouts and their corresponding IDs if you wish to verify the definitions in-game. . (Book, {Title}) - The word as it appears in an in-game book. The most commonly cited books are Songs of Skyrim and Dragon Language: Myth No More. . ({Speaker}, {Form ID}) - The word as it appears in dialogue, copied verbatim from the Skyrim's dialogue file* exported from the Creation Kit. The cited Form ID refers to the specific line or group of dialogue where the word occurs.  * The linked file includes dialogue from the base game but not the Dawnguard or Dragonborn DLCs. Some dialogue citations occur in Dawnguard or Dragonborn dialogue. These must be verified in the Creation Kit at this time. . (Word Wall for {Word}, {Shout}) - The word as it appears in a Word Wall where Word of Powers are obtained. The citation notes the Shout and Word of Power of the Word Wall where the word occurs. Official transcriptions and translations are taken from the Prima Games Official Game Guide: Legendary Edition. Some Word Walls do not occur in the guide or in-game, and are taken from Creation Kit files. Some words do not occur outside of these unused Word Walls. See UESP.net for more information.  Connotations The Connotations section explains a word's meaning in more depth than the dictionary definition, noting what things it may be associated with and how it differs from similar words. All connotations are hypothetical and are gleaned from its usage. A word's etymology may also inform its connotations, especially where a word may have limited or no usage. In some instances, not enough information exists to provide connotation notes.  Etymology The Etymology section lists the internal origin of a word. Most etymologies are hypothetical except where noted in the official definition. Some etymologies are more hypothetical than others; etymologies that require the fewest assumptions are favored. Etymologies may sometimes inform a word's definition and connotations, especially where it may have limited or no usage to reference. Etymologies describe how a word is derived, not how it forms other words. For example, the etymology section for zeymahzin 'companion' will reference zeymah 'brother', but the etymology section for zeymah will not reference zeymahzin. Reference the See Also section instead for other words that are derived from a word.  Notes The Notes section provides any other information about a word, such as trivia, possible external origins, and ways in which a word should or should not be used.   Alphabet & Pronunciation  Below is a brief list of the dragon language’s 34 runes with their transliterations and typical IPA pronunciations.

(Alduin, 000EDF49)  Connotations Typically denotes a person who serves by their own free will, as an act of duty or loyalty, rather than by enslavement or domination. This distinction blurs in dragon culture, where loyalty is owed to the strongest and most dominant. Related word zaam specifically refers to a slave without free will.  Etymology Related to aam ‘to serve’.  Notes Also appears as aan in one line of dialogue, either a variant or possibly a mistake.     Aav 1V  Word Type strong verb  Pronunciation /.v/  Official Definition Join  (Dialogue File, 000C64F2)  (POGGLE, p. 1096)  (PrimaGames.com)  Expanded Definition v. to join forces, efforts, sides, or company  n. union, unison, unity  Usage Fah ok unslaad mid rok aav dilon voth lot zin.

(Paarthurnax, 000D2CF4)    Connotations If dragon in origin, likely refers to the geographical hill upon which Whiterun is built more so than the city itself.  Etymology Se compound of ahrol ‘hill’ and dovah ‘dragon’, lit. ‘hill of the dragon’.  Notes Paarthurnax refers to Whiterun as ‘the Hill of the Dovah’ (000D2CF4), indicating a dragon origin rather than an invention by Jarl Gjalund.   Ahst 4ST  Word Type preposition  Pronunciation /.st/  Official Definition At  (Book, Songs of Skyrim)  (Dialogue File, 0009C20A)  (POGGLE, p. 6, 1096)  (PrimaGames.com)  Expanded Definition prep. at, indicating state or condition (‘at peace’, ‘at bay’); at, towards; at, instrumental (‘at the hands of’)  Usage Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!

Through the use of the Voice, the vital power of a Nord can be articulated into a thu'um, or shout. Shouts can be used to sharpen blades or to strike enemies at a distance. Masters of the Voice are known as Tongues, and their power is legendary. They can call to specific people over hundreds of miles, and can move by casting a shout, appearing where it lands.

Otherwise, zohungaar is greater in degree than hungaar.     Zok ZOK  Word Type strong adjective  Pronunciation /zok/  Official Definition Most  (Dialogue File, 000ED362)  (POGGLE, p. 1097)  (PrimaGames.com)  Expanded Definition adj. great, greatest amount or degree of  adv. most (superlative)  n. most, greatest  v. to make or become the greatest or most  Usage Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein.

This stone commemorates the horse Sarvirra, the most courageous Animal ever to charge the snowy battlefields, and give his soul for his lord.  (Word Wall for Raan, Animal Allegiance)  Notes Used to form superlatives (zok mul ‘strongest / most strong’) and other comparisons. May also be used with nouns to mean ‘great amount of’. Not used to mean ‘majority’ as in ‘most people’, or a pronoun as in ‘most will fail’. See pogaan ‘many’ instead.   Zol ZOL  Word Type noun  Pronunciation /zol/  Official Definition Zombie  (Soul Tear Shout)  (POGGLE, p. 1097)  (PrimaGames.com)  Expanded Definition n. zombie  Usage Rii vaaz zol!

Modir the Far raised this stone for his brother, Oskar the Fool, whose Voice was weak, and not the mighty Thu’um of his clan.  (Word Wall for Throw Voice)  Connotations Word of Power, not the formal name for the power of the Voice (see thu’um) but can be used in reference to it.  Etymology Possibly related to zun ‘weapon’ or shares root with zaan ‘shout’.  Notes At one point was vun rather than zul. Vun is still audible in the Throw Voice Shout and appears instead of zul in the dialogue file.   Zun ZUN  Word Type noun  Pronunciation /zun/  Official Definition Weapon  (Disarm Shout)  (POGGLE, p. 1097)  (PrimaGames.com)  Expanded Definition n. weapon, weaponry  Usage Zun haal viik!
