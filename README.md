# Elder-Scrolls-Dovahzul
Hi, and welcome to the Github repo for PSU Behrend's Spring 2024 DIGIT 210 Elder Scrolls project!
This project is all about experimenting using a language model, and seeing if we can train a language model using a fantasy language.
If we're lucky, we may even be able to make a chatbot out of it!

This project is piloted by Tyler Gaydos and Owen Helm of Dr. Beshero-Bonder's DIGIT 210 class.
